          <h3>An Interview with Phil Hayes</h3>
          <div>
                Phil Hayes is an IT professional with 39 years of experience. Phil kindly took the time to answer some of our questions.
          </div>
          <div class="question">
                Tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
              
              <p>Working in IT for as long as I have I’ve pretty much worked in every role.
                  The role I’ll be talking about today is the role I held with ESTA (Emergency Service Telecommunication Authority).</p>
              <p>I was employed as their security manager. They had an external security 
                  audit and it had come up below average, and in need of improvement. 
                  I was with them seven years and held several titles as well as security 
                  manager during my ime there, risk disaster recovery, business continuity, 
                  infrastructure manager roles and architect manager.</p>
              <p>I specialise in computer security and I take it differently to most people, 
                  at a corporate level computer security is anything that may impact the business 
                  continuity of the service. If anything can impact the service the security manager 
                  is involved.</br>
                  This ranged from ensuring UPS and fuel for generators to keep the service running, 
                  as well as risk analysis, prediction and estimates during pandemics and other disasters or threats.</p>
              <p>An example of this estimate was running analysis for a spanish flu outbreak and 
                  determining that of a workforce of 800 there would be 60 potential losses, 
                  which would need to be accounted for as a loss of personnel during a time of raised threat.</p>
              <p>During my time working as a Infrastructure manager I was asked by the board of 
                  directors to do a projection of our IT infrastructure over the next 5 years. 
                  We looked at the effort in the severs and the growth in call rates over the past couple of years, 
                  weather events, amount of people moving to Victoria. If you have more people in 
                  Victoria you will have more people calling 000 it’s just a fact of life. Events 
                  where TV stations show ads about heart health, after these events you have more calls to 000. 
                  Hot nights, football weekends, cold nights, during these events more resources will 
                  be needed as there will be a spike in calls.</p>
              <p>We used the busiest day on record to come up with a baseline for resources, 
                  and scaled up from there. I immediately assumed that it would be Black Saturday. 
                  Not even close. Black Saturday was a busy day, but it kept going, it was busy. 
                  With an average day having 4,000 to 4,500 calls a day. <em>Black Saturday had 12,000 
                      to 12,500 calls a day.</em></p>
              <p>Believe it or not the worst day on record was Christmas Day 2011. The hail storms on 
                  Christmas day 2011. On the day in question they took 3,500 in 90 minutes, 
                  that’s normally what they would do in a day.</p>
              <p>We went through and did all the figures based on those sorts of loads, ramped it 
                  all up and estimated how much equipment they’d need five years out and 
                  went out and bought it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
                Tell us about the industry you work in
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>I’ve been working in the IT industry since 1981, with 3 years working in IT related roles beforehand.</p>
              <p>ESTA is the service which takes calls and is responsible for the dispatch of services 
                  when an emergency call is made. This is <strong>critical</strong> infrastructure, 
                  it doesn't get any more critical than that.</p>
              <p>ESTA runs differently in Victoria than other states emergency services call centers. 
                  Whenever a call is made you are asked if you require police, ambulance, or 
                  fire then redirected to the appropriate call center.</p>
              <p>With ESTA, these 3 call centers are actually one, so when a call is made and 
                  dispatch is required any other required services are dispatched at the same time. 
                  In the case of a car accident on a freeway, an ambulance would be sent for victims, 
                  police for sectioning off the area and fire trucks to hose down any fuel, 
                  all from the one call.</p>
              <p>The difficulty with the industry is that getting the resources and the tech is 
                  easy. You can just throw money at it. The people are what’s needed. 
                  Out of 100 people about 5 get through to the job, within 12 months that 
                  would go down to about 3.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
                What other kinds of work do you have to do?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
              
The obvious one is reporting, you have to set up reporting schedules. Some material goes to the board of directors, to the executive leadership team, done on a monthly or quarterly basis. With reports about risk management, auditing functions, security incidents. 

Auditing functions, we create accounts for people to sign on. When people have issues they will call and complain about it not working, but when people leave they are less likely to call and tell you that it’s still working. You set up processing and procedures about what has to happen, and twice a year i would compare the active directory and compare it to the HR master. If they’re not on the HR master then you need to start asking questions and get the accounts deactivated.

Staff of ESTA were required to have a police check in order to become employees and work for ESTA. These checks need to be maintained and if one name comes up in a criminal incident that affects their current clearance and then we would be notified. This would affect the customer if it results in the police check being pulled 

What else did we do? There was compliance. Large corporate organisations would run audits and by that I mean like a financial audit but for security. We had external auditors, and government auditors and they would make sure you were up to the standards that we need to comply with. 
You would get a major non-compliance, which needs to be complied with immediately. A minor non-compliance, which is something that isn't up to scratch and you need to look at this and fix it. Then there's an opportunity for improvement, which is something you could do to make it better but it's not required. 

The majors and the minors would go into a risk register or a corrective action register, whereas a non-compliance would go into a corrective act register. Where anything on the risk register needs to be solved immediately. 
To solve these issues senior management is given a risk management or the ‘opportunity cost’ to fix versus the risk they will take on if it is not fixed.

An example I use. Let's assume we have a factory and it has a courtyard and in that courtyard there is a camera that will get smashed every Friday and it wont get fixed until Monday. 
You can replace it on Monday for $500 each week, or install a cage that prevents it for $200,000.
But now there's the risk, if something could happen which leaves you liable, like a death, then it has to be done! There isn't a choice to be made if that's the case. 

We had a scenario where they may have been a potential breach of information, this would involve personal information being leaked. You don't want insurers knowing who has just had a heart attack. You had to be careful with who has access to the system. The solution was to air gap the entire CAD system, with the back up having 3 sites with direct line connections to prevent any potential hacks.

          <div class="question">
              
Tell us about the people you interact with in your work?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
              
Starting from the ground up starting at call takers and dispatchers. These are the people taking the calls and I did security awareness training. If they ever had a security question to ask I was the person to ask. 

Obviously all of the administrative staff, all the employees that are involved in running a business, and dealing with the IT risks and safety measures that go with them. The standard funny looking emails requesting information from the employee. 

Then there's the executives and their reports for monthly and quarterly meetings, in regards to the risk management of the business and going through the information and ensuring it's understood. 

The next level up is the board of directors, and I would generally deal with them once every three months. Specifically for security issues and concerns. When working as a systems architect I would advise them of what resources and materials are required, since in these cases the hardware has a shelf life and needs to be replaced. 

I would deal with all levels of the organisation. Then there’s the external organisation, i would deal with the person who would do the police checks. I would deal with physical access to the building for ESTA staff. 

I left out the federal government, we got ESTA a sign on with the ASD (Australian Signals Directory). Where they keep records of emerging eventualities, so that we could see any issue that may affect ESTA. I was sent an email about an emerging problem and got our systems admis to install it. A few weeks later ESTA NSW went down due to the emerging eventuality.

          <div class="question">
              
Tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
              
Security deals with everybody, it is quite common to deal with everyone as they are interested in supplying the service, uninterrupted. It’s not uncommon for the security guy to have a better idea of how things work and how they fit together than other people in the company besides the enterprise architect. Because you want to know which ports are coming in, which switches are being used, what brands are being used, when they’re being maintained, who’s doing the updates on the operating systems of the switch, are the servers being used properly, what are the system we are using for two factor authentication, whats are ID card system, what family of cards are we using, it across the board. 

I'm the Ombudsman for security. I need to ensure that protocols are being followed. So I deal with everyone in the IT areas. 
What about your interactions with clients or investors?
I have never been involved with investors as I have never had to sell something to someone. Vendors, though, I have had a lot of interaction with vendors, them trying to sell us stuff, where we were the client. 
IBM hardware, oracle licensing, HP printers, lennox computers. I would contact these vendors and tell them this is what we need, give me a quote. 

We had a problem with citrix and their print drivers, we had a company that came in and did an evaluation for us. They advised we needed a printer service that was HP compatible, and from there we went through HP to solve the issue. Lexmark versus HP in regards to HP compatibility, it was a no brainer.

What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
              
The worst part of my job is managing people. One statistic that is very high but no one will agree on is the risk that people bring to the system. Some say 80% some go more towards 90%. The biggest security risk is the people, when they’re not thinking straight. You spend most of your time getting people to think the right way, to think about security as part of their role everyday. 
The technology is easy to fix, check and update but it does take time. 

My work is very cyclic, my calendar says every monday i check the licenses. In my current position I've created a security calendar and have scheduled out how much time and labor is required. Your auditor will come in and demand reports about how you have governed your patching over the past year, and you can say here's my report. How's my governing?
If you don't do it, that's when you get bitten and that's when you lose your job. 
          </div>
          <div class="question">
              
Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
              
In security you are your own worst enemy. The better work you do the more the managers see security as taking up too many resources. 
Over the past forty years I’ve seen a change in management styles and i dont think it's changing for the better. 
It hasn't been an old vs new it's been a gradual transition. Going back to the 70’s when i started Managers had been with their industry, with their company for a long time to become a manager, typically it was a home grown promotion. 
Because they've been through the jobs they thought about the people. If for example the company needs shift work, the managers would ask and give everyone their fair share. 

Through the 90’s the management was brought in from outside and these people had less experience with the business but the concept was any manager could do any job. About that time they started looking at humans as a resource and at that a disposal resource. A gradual change started happening where the middle manager or the higher manager would see the staff as a resource that can be chewed up and spit out and you can always get more. The manager would see the position more as what can I do to make my CV look good? Because I’m only going to be here for a couple of years, before moving onto the next job. 

The next step from that is that the manager looks to appoint someone with the same point of view, these managers don't really care about the outcomes of their changes because they are gone when the changes blow up. It’s becoming self sufficient, and a real problem. 

When I started at ESTA the managers were 100% committed to the employees, towards the end i would say only 50%. 
It’s quite common to have the general manager of IT as an accountant. It’s not universal but it is quite common. On several occasions I have worked in these cases and they have only been concerned with cutting costs, padding their CV and moving onto the next job. 

You get brought on to solely solve compliance issues, after a couple of years the audits are coming back quite well. That’s when costs are cut for security, instead you point out risks through risk management and let the higher ups know. You advise of the risk and the CEO has to fix it or wear the consequences. The risk manager is not responsible for solving the risk or managing it, but for tracking it and offering advice, reporting on it.
For managers padding their resume, sometimes the advice is to not place the risk in the risk register, I have left roles because of this.
          </div>
          <div class="question">
              
Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
              
People think security is boring but aspects of it are quite challenging. I started with a computer that had 12kb of memory on it. In 1983/1984 I was working on a mainframe that had 1.2Mb of memory. Sitting on my desk I’ve got 70Tb. The industry is not only changing, it's changing at an accelerated pace. If you work in IT you will be studying for the rest of your life. 

If you get into IT you will never stop studying the knowledge you have and language will be changing, the skills for a language will change but the logic skills can still be used. 

You can wear a watch with 128Gb of memory and we have made these changes in 50 years. So if you're going into IT don't think you will get your degree and that's it, you will always be studying. They are teaching you to think and how to learn. 

The best way to capture the essence of IT, you will keep studying!
