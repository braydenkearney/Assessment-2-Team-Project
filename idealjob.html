          When comparing and contrasting the different ideal jobs within the
          group, the main things to examine are the skills, qualifications and
          experience required to get into these fields for each individual.
          The different ideal jobs for the group include; software engineer,
          senior engineer, consultant, IT security specialist and full stack
          developer. Figure 1 displays the common elements which are the
          overlapping skills and qualifications required for each job.
          Figure 2 displays what differentiates each job, which are the non overlapping
          required skills and experience.
          When examining the common elements for these jobs the most common were good
          communication skills and general program language knowledge (shown in figure 1).
          As each of these jobs will include working as a team or talking to clients,
          good communication skills (verbal or written) are essential to deliver and
          understand information efficiently and accurately. Each of these jobs will
          also come across programming  (some more then others) making it a common
          element within the ideal jobs.
          Although these jobs have some broader common elements there are also key
          aspects that differentiate the positions. Software engineers, senior engineers
          and full stack developers are different from the other jobs because they require
          design skills.  The consultant and IT security specialist jobs are different
          because they require system management and problem solving skills. IT security
          specialist is different from the rest of the jobs because it requires a knowledge
          of IT security skills. Consultant is different from the other jobs because it
          requires knowledge of virtualization and the cloud.
          Amanda, Sean and Sholom all have similar career plans as there are all heading
          towards a software engineer career. However the rest of the group differs, each
          heading into their own career paths.
