            <p class="card-text"> I was born and raised in Queensland Australia and have just returned back to the Gold Coast  
              from a two year working holiday in the Rocky Mountains of Jasper, Canada. 
              My hobbies include all board sports such as skateboarding, snowboarding and surfing. 
              I also enjoy adventures in the wild such as hiking and sightseeing. Ever since I was young I have had a passion for IT, 
              the main areas including; video editing and gaming. My IT experience to date is very basic, 
              in grades 11 and 12 I studied an IT course for one of my subjects. In this course we learnt very basic website design, 
              basic code language and basic games design using Scratch. Other than that my IT experience only includes self teaching, 
              for example teaching myself how to edit videos.

            <p class="card-text">Call me Iver. Born in Qatar, Filipino and moved to Australia around 2010. I’m 17 years
              old and I still speak my native tongue (filipino). I have many hobbies that I do; skateboarding,
              cardistry, magic, videography. I have multiple side businesses that I do. This consists of photography,
              videography and eCommerce. I work full-time at Bureau Veritas in the mining and oil & gas industry as a
              NDT Technician (Non-Destructive Testing). In the future, I want to be able to develop and deploy web &
              phone apps and perhaps work at a startup company. In terms of IT experience, I have built computers for
              other people and studied it a bit during Year 11-12. I like to work with web apps especially with nginx
              and javascript that I find on GitHub and try to see how everything works. No real IT experience as of yet.

                I was born in Perth and lived in the USA for 12
                years.  I’ve also lived in the UK for a few years and many years 
                in Sydney.  I now call Canberra home. I have had a long interest 
                in IT. I started working as an application and database developer 
                in the late 90's. I left the industry in the early 2000's to start 
                the first of several of my own businesses. Mostly, I find the problem 
                solving and the ability to make your own tools very satisfying. 
                Networks are interesting and a recent Raspberry Pi purchase has 
                inspired me to start building a basic computer from scratch using 
                breadboards and EEPROM chips.
