            <p class="card-text"> I was born and raised in Queensland Australia and have just returned back to the Gold Coast  
              from a two year working holiday in the Rocky Mountains of Jasper, Canada. 
              My hobbies include all board sports such as skateboarding, snowboarding and surfing. 
              I also enjoy adventures in the wild such as hiking and sightseeing. Ever since I was young I have had a passion for IT, 
              the main areas including; video editing and gaming. My IT experience to date is very basic, 
              in grades 11 and 12 I studied an IT course for one of my subjects. In this course we learnt very basic website design, 
              basic code language and basic games design using Scratch. Other than that my IT experience only includes self teaching, 
              for example teaching myself how to edit videos.

            <p class="card-text">Call me Iver. Born in Qatar, Filipino and moved to Australia around 2010. I’m 17 years
              old and I still speak my native tongue (filipino). I have many hobbies that I do; skateboarding,
              cardistry, magic, videography. I have multiple side businesses that I do. This consists of photography,
              videography and eCommerce. I work full-time at Bureau Veritas in the mining and oil & gas industry as a
              NDT Technician (Non-Destructive Testing). In the future, I want to be able to develop and deploy web &
              phone apps and perhaps work at a startup company. In terms of IT experience, I have built computers for
              other people and studied it a bit during Year 11-12. I like to work with web apps especially with nginx
              and javascript that I find on GitHub and try to see how everything works. No real IT experience as of yet.

                I was born in Perth and lived in the USA for 12
                years.  I’ve also lived in the UK for a few years and many years 
                in Sydney.  I now call Canberra home. I have had a long interest 
                in IT. I started working as an application and database developer 
                in the late 90's. I left the industry in the early 2000's to start 
                the first of several of my own businesses. Mostly, I find the problem 
                solving and the ability to make your own tools very satisfying. 
                Networks are interesting and a recent Raspberry Pi purchase has 
                inspired me to start building a basic computer from scratch using 
                breadboards and EEPROM chips.

              I'm 21, I want to start my own IT business or join a software development company. 
              My hobbies are varied but include; Gaming, Graphic Design and Anime. I want to 
              create software that can help people all over the world or develop games that 
              redefine the genre. I have previously completed a Certificate in IT earlier this
              year and wanted to take on further study with the intentions of gaining the skills
              and experience required for entering the workforce.</p>

              I was born and raised in Melbourne Australia and have recently
              returned from America where I had been doing some religious studies. My hobbies
              include sports, mainly soccer, footy and cricket, reading and a bit of pc gaming.
              My IT interest is in programming ever since I realized how logic based it was.
              My IT experience currently is limited to a bit of self-taught programming.</p>

            <p class="card-text">I’m Sean as simple as it sounds, born and raised in Melbourne and have basically 
              been raised off the amazing food of Melbourne cafes, restaurants and bars. My parents were born and 
              raised here as well and it eventually goes all the way back to Ireland, Scotland, and France. I’ve 
              previously studied a Bachelor of Science / Science Education through La Trobe University and have 
              taught for three years in different schools. After noticing issues that weren’t going to change 
              themselves any time soon I decided to find myself a job with a lower workload and get back to 
              my studies, where I could learn I.T. Then try and make a difference to those issues that are ever 
              present in teaching. I’m a simple monolingual only speaking english. 
              I’ve done some simple online modules for python, SQL, HTML and CSS but haven’t had the chance to use any of 
              these skills in the industry as of yet.</p>
