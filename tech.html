        <h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that are controlled by a computer rather than 
            a person. When dealing with autonomous vehicles there are generally 6 levels going 
            from 0 to 5 used with 0 being fully controlled by humans and 5 being completely 
            self-driven vehicles. The most common level car available amongst new cars is level 2, 
            with many new cars containing things like lane assist and adaptive cruise control and 
            the ability of these 2 functions running simultaneously gives them the level 2 classification.  
            The highest-level vehicle currently publicly available is the 
            level 3 Audi R8 with a couple of other level 3 vehicles on the way, which means 
            in specific conditions, like a highway in good weather it is fully automated, 
            however the driver must be ready to take control at any time. The most advanced 
            automated cars currently in existence are level 4 cars which are owned and used by 
            companies like Waymo and others. Level 4 means that they are fully autonomous in most 
            situations but not all. The reason these cars are not fully available for the public is 
            because the way that they work is that they are programmed to know specific 
            areas and routes very well so therefore not viable for public use. The predictions 
            for when level 5 cars, which are fully self-driving in all situations will be first 
            made range anywhere from within the year with Elon Musk says Tesla is very close, to in 
            multiple decades with experts at business Insider predicting we are probably several 
            decade away from being able to sleep in a self-driven car across New York. However even 
            after level 5 autonomous cars are made it will take a long time for them to become 
            legal and even longer for them to become common. Before level 5 autonomous vehicles 
            become legal it will most likely have to be proven that they are safer than human 
            driven cars in almost all, if not all situations. Driverless cars are made possible by 
            several different technologies including cameras, radars LIDAR to recognize obstacles 
            around them, they use  a cloud connection to work out weather conditions, 
            traffic conditions and also to improve monitoring of nearby vehicles, and then 
            finally they need the software to help make the decisions. The part that needs 
            the most work is the software as this is the biggest difference between the level 4 
            cars around today and the level 5 cars of the future. The main issues with the software 
            currently are getting it to be able to react to uncommon situations or situations 
            out of its comfort zone for example what happens when it snows and it can no longer 
            see the lines on the road or how it deals with roadwork and things like that.
          </p>  
        </div>

        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The invention of autonomous vehicles will very likely have a major impact on the 
            world. The most negative impact on society will probably be the mass loss of jobs. 
            With driverless cars being available the first users will mainly be the taxi companies, 
            trucking companies and bus companies causing all their drivers to lose their jobs. 
            Furthermore, once they start becoming more common for private owners then driving 
            licenses will become unnecessary causing lots of driving instructors and testers to 
            lose their jobs. One of the positive effects will be safety, a vast majority 
            of car crashes are caused by human error, therefore when you take out the chance of 
            human error it will majorly reduce the amount of accidents. Whilst this is a positive 
            effect it also means that car insurance will not be nearly as required, and a lot of 
            insurance companies will be forced to close causing even more people to lose their jobs. 
            Another positive effect will be reducing the number of cars on the road, the reason this 
            will happen is because people will be able to share cars a lot 
            more easily and also less accidents will reduce traffic. The negative side effect of 
            this is that it will mean the car industry will go down significantly causing even more job 
            loss. The last negative effect will be the fact that cars will be able to be hacked giving 
            another method for terrorism. So, in conclusion driverless cars in general will have a very 
            positive impact on the environment and on many people's lives however it will cause the loss of many jobs.

        <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            How autonomous vehicles will affect my personal life, or the lives of my family 
            members is almost impossible to know. If there was a definite time period on when 
            autonomous vehicles would become available to the public, or even just when level 4 
            vehicles will become available for deliveries or as taxis then maybe the question 
            would be answerable. For example, if they were to become available in the next couple 
            of years for deliveries then they would very possibly be used by some of my relatives, 
            on the other hand if they don’t become available for 10 plus years 
            then the companies that we could use them for might no longer exist. That was only 
            for level 4 vehicles but for how level 5 vehicles will affect me is even harder to 
            guess, first of all they are probably even further away meaning don’t know what I 
            will be doing with my life for example I may just be working from home and the only 
            thing that will change is if I need a taxi somewhere it won't have a driver or I might 
            have to drive around all day to different offices and having a driverless 
            car will allow me to use my time a lot more efficiently as I will be able to work 
            whilst driving and the same goes for everyone else I know. However whenever driverless cars 
            do become available it will have a positive impact on most people's lives because it will 
            reduce the number of accidents, it should reduce traffic congestion and should also improve 
            a lot of people's productivity because they will no longer have to waste time whilst driving 
            and will be able to work or do something else.

        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>

        <h3>What is Cybersecurity?</h3>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            A definition of the topic can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security">Wikipedia</a> that is as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>  
              Cybersecurity is the protection of computer systems and networks from the theft of 
              or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the 
              disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
            </i>  
          </p>
          <p>  
            A Cybersecurity professional is expected to be able to implement and advise on the 
            latest best practices to follow for organisations and individuals who wish to protect 
            their data and businesses from potential threats.
          </p>
          <p>  
            The state of the art in Cybersecurity is a rapidly and constantly changing boundary. 
            It requires constant effort to maintain high standards. Individuals and societies ever 
            increasing reliance on more and more complicated electronic systems means the detection 
            and remediation of potential vulnerabilities is always evolving.
          </p>
          <p>  
            One of the interesting aspects of our current electronic systems is the communication 
            can always be reduced to a simple voltage high or low signal and a clock. These two 
            voltage states represent the binary one and zero language in which all current systems 
            understand and communicate.
          </p>
          <p>  
            An actor's ability to intercept and understand this code and an opposite actor's 
            ability to deny that ability is what drives the evolution of the field. In this way, 
            Cybersecurity can be seen as a specific incarnation of a very human activity, literally 
            going back thousands of years.
          </p>
          <p>  
            Work is constantly being done to identify flaws in systems and how to exploit or 
            re-mediate them. For individuals, the threats currently often involve ransom-ware or 
            the stealing of financial details. In these cases, the threat actor seeks to sell or 
            extort their victim for money.
          </p>
          <p>  
            For organisations and businesses, we are currently seeing increasing efforts 
            to steal intellectual property. In these cases, the attackers wish to remain anonymous 
            for as long as possible so the intellectual property can be leveraged for a competitive advantage.
            <img src="cybersecurity_bar_graph.jpg">

              Fig 1 Source: <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/cost-cybercrime-study">Accenture.com</a>
            </i>  
            As can be seen from the chart above, ransom-ware and malicious individuals inside 
            an organisation present the two largest threats.
          </p>
          <p>  
            Stealing the data of the target is the most common and expensive outcome from 
            Cybersecurity failures. However, it is worth noting that it is now becoming more 
            common for attackers to attempt to alter or destroy data of a target. The aims of 
            these types of attacks are to make it more difficult to trust the integrity of the 
            information being protected.
          </p>
          <p>  
            As electronic means of protection become more sophisticated, so do the attack 
            vectors. Criminals are adapting to these changes by targeting the weakest link in 
            the Cybersecurity chain – the human.
            As people store more personal information on-line via services like social media, 
            attacks known as phishing are becoming more common. These attacks involve attempting 
            to impersonate an individual or company in order to deceive a person into divulging sensitive information.

        <h2>What are the impacts?</h2>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            It is very difficult to determine accurate dollar figures for the cost of Cybercrime. 
            As was mentioned above, often it is very difficult to discover, especially when the 
            attacker does not wish to publicise a break of security.
          </p>
          <p>  
            The estimates of the dollar value of cybercrime are all over the place and vary 
            widely. As an example, some current estimates of the damage in the US range from the 
            billions to the trillions of dollars. However, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-breaches-now-cost-companies-an-average-of-1-41-million/">TechRepublic</a> reports that the average 
            security budget for companies in the US has risen to $18.9 million dollars in 2019, 
            up from $8.9 million in 2018. The cost of a corporate data breach is around $1.4 million 
            US dollars per breach. The report also details how companies that have a security 
            operations centre report the cost of a breach being half the average amount.
          </p>
          <p>  
            The <a href="https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/80-eye-opening-cyber-security-statistics-for-2019/">SSL Store</a> reports that the cybercrime economy is at least $1.5 trillion US 
            dollars. The market for Cybersecurity products is predicted to reach $300 billion US 
            dollars over the next few years.

        <h2>What can be done?</h2>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Research into this topic is constantly evolving. Microsoft reports that up to 
            70% of the flaws in its software projects are due to memory safety issues.

            More modern memory safe languages like Rust are working to replace older languages 
            where these types of errors are more common.
          </p>
          <p>  
            Education is commonly cited as one solution to reduce the threats from cybercrime. 
            As we have noted previously, the human factor is often the weak link. Password 
            managers are a popular tool to improve personal security as well as two factor 
            authentication. However, it is worth noting some rather bleak statistics
          </p>  
          <ul> 
            <li>71% of accounts are protected by passwords used on multiple websites</li> 	
            <li>A single password is used to access five accounts on average</li>
            <li>60% of people include a name or date of birth in the on-line account passwords</li>
            <li>Only 45% of users change their password after a data breach</li>
            <li>25% of people admit to using passwords like “123456” and ‘qwerty’</li>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            As has been shown, the size of the problem is only getting larger as more of our 
            lives exist in a digital space. The rewards for bad actors therefore increases and our 
            need to exhibit better security practices grow.
          </p>
          <p>  
            It is incumbent on all individuals to take it upon themselves to educate and protect 
            themselves on-line. The costs of mitigation provide a positive return on the investment.
            My hope for the future is that we are currently in a stage of social development 
            where we are still working out the benefits and limits of rapidly changing technology. 
            Hopefully, future generations will grow up already inoculated to many of the downsides 
            of a digital world.
          </p>
          <p>  
            For now and into the foreseeable future, the need and therefore opportunities for 
            cybersecurity professionals will continue to grow. It is an exciting time to be 
            involved in one of the most competitive areas of computing today.

        <h2>Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrencies</h2>

        <h2>What does it do?</h2>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Blockchain is a distributed database existing on multiple computers at the same time. 
            It is constantly growing as new sets of recordings, or 'blocks', are added to it. In 
            simple terms, a blockchain is a way of passing information from A to B in a fully 
            automated and safe manner. When a transaction is made, one party starts the process 
            and a network of nodes validates the transaction and the user's status through algorithms. 
            Once verified a block is created. This block is then verified by computers and added to a 
            chain that is stored across the net. Now the transaction is 
            completed and because of the blockchain it is permanent and unalterable.  What makes 
            it so great is that it's free, a blockchain can transfer and store money and in a sense 
            replace processes that rely on a small fee for transactions.  A blockchain is what enables 
            the existence of cryptocurrencies. They also have potential applications that go beyond 
            cryptocurrencies, these include; manage fractional ownership in autonomous vehicles, 
            save billions of dollars on transaction costs, the ability to 
            cast votes from a smartphone and make it safer for patients encrypted health information 
            to be shared with multiple providers.
          </p>
          <p>   
            Cryptocurrency is a digital asset, designed to work as a means of exchange which uses 
            cryptographic functions to conduct financial transactions. Anyone can exchange real 
            currency for cryptocurrency and once you own it is like any form of payment that can 
            be exchanged online for goods. However, cryptocurrency is secured by cryptography, 
            which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. The key thing that 
            sets cryptocurrency apart from any other currency is that because of the decentralized 
            nature of the blockchain it is not controlled by any central authority, 
            making the currency immune to any form of government control. What this means is; the 
            currencies supply is not determined by a central bank, the currency has no physical 
            form like cash and only exists digitally and it has no intrinsic value, meaning it 
            can be used for another commodity such as gold. Transactions are verified by people 
            called cryptocurrency miners and then they are added to the public ledger. Miners use 
            powerful computers to solve complex math problems. Mining is an open 
            source which means anyone can confirm any transaction and the first miner that solves 
            the problem gets to add the block to their transaction ledger. This miner is then 
            rewarded by being able to authorise the transaction and in return for the service 
            they earn small amounts of cryptocurrency. The original and most commonly used form 
            of cryptocurrency is Bitcoin and there are currently 16.8 million Bitcoin in circulation.

            Although it's already been a year since the arrival of cryptocurrencies, there are 
            predictions that in the future businesses will start using cryptocurrencies for their 
            services. This has the potential to cut out the middleman. Which will reduce costs and 
            add the ability to make it cheaper for customers. It is also predicted that in the near 
            future government agencies will soon start adopting Blockchain technology for the nature 
            of decentralized systems. An example of this is how the Estonian Government uses 
            blockchain technology called X-Rod, which stores complete credentials 
            for all citizens. In the future, banks will eventually start to accept cryptocurrencies. 
            When this happens these things will become the norm;
          </p>   
          <ul> 
            <li>People will have bank accounts for cryptocurrencies.</li>
            <li>People will be able to purchase cryptocurrencies from banks and ATMs</li>
            <li>Debit cards that hold cryptocurrencies</li>
            </ul>
          <p>  
            When looking further into the future Blockchain technology and combining it with the 
            adjacent technologies it has the ability to do things that have never been done before. 
            Blockchain offers more trustworthy data that will better inform and strengthen underlying 
            algorithms. This data will be kept secure and blockchain will audit every step in the 
            decision-making process. Therefore this will enable sharper insights driven by data that 
            network participants trust.

            Cryptocurrencies are still in the very early stages but they are already starting to 
            transform the global economy. Transactions of cryptocurrencies do not require any 
            connection to any dollar, this adds another avenue for financial transactions that 
            participate in the global economy but at the same time also avoid traditional economic 
            policies. This has the potential to impact governments because traditional dollars are 
            the reserve currency for the global economy and are commonly recognised as the main 
            source of power. Cryptocurrencies are also likely to have an effect on middlemans, 
            potentially completely cutting them out. Unlike our traditional currencies, cryptocurrency 
            transitions are decentralized and don’t require a third party. This has the potential 
            to impact third parties like banks, as cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for their service. 
            Blockchain technology has great potential for impacts in the world of cybersecurity. When 
            using blockchain All data is verified and encrypted using advanced cryptography which 
            makes it resistant to unauthorized changes and hacks. Standard centralized servers are 
            likely to see; loss of data, corruption and hacking. However if a decentralized 
            blockchain is used it would allow for data storage in the cloud to be more robust and 
            protected against attacks. This is likely to impact that way we look at cybersecurity 
            and have for the potential to one day completely defend against unwanted attacks. 
            The people most that will be most affected by cryptocurrencies are governments and banks. 
            This is because of the fact that they are unable to control the currencies and there is 
            no need for a middle man when using cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are also likely 
            to impact people in developing countries. They could provide a significant benefit to 
            these countries by overcoming the lack of social trust and by increasing the access to financial services.
