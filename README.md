<P>BRAYDEN: I was born and raised in Queensland Australia and have just returned back to the Gold Coast  from a two year working holiday in the Rocky Mountains of Jasper, Canada. My hobbies include all board sports such as skateboarding, snowboarding and surfing. I also enjoy adventures in the wild such as hiking and sightseeing. Ever since I was young I have had a passion for IT, the main areas including; video editing and gaming. My IT experience to date is very basic, in grades 11 and 12 I studied an IT course for one of my subjects. In this course we learnt very basic website design, basic code language and basic games design using Scratch. Other than that my IT experience only includes self teaching, for example teaching myself how to edit videos.<P>
